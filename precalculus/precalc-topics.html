        <h2>Distance and midpoint formulas</h2>
        <div>The <strong>distance</strong> between two points <span data-math>A=(x_1,y_1)</span> and <span data-math>B=(x_2,y_2)</span> in the xy-plane is
          <div data-math>d(A,B)=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}</div>

        <h2>Graph of an equation in two variables</h2>
        <div>The <strong>graph of an equation in two variables</strong> <span data-math>x</span> and <span data-math>y</span> is the set of points in the xy-plane the coordinates <span data-math>(x,y)</span> of which satisfy the equation. A point <span data-math>(x,y)</span> is <strong>on the graph</strong> of an equation when <span data-math>x</span> and <span data-math>y</span> satisfy the equation, and a point <span data-math>(x,y)</span> is <strong>not on the graph</strong> of an equation when <span data-math>x</span> and <span data-math>y</span> do not satisfy the equation</div>
        <div>
          <h3>Intercepts of graphs</h3>
          <div>Points on the graph of an equation that touch or cross the coordinate axes (or equivalently, a point with coordinates <span data-math>(x,y)</span> that satisfies the equation with either <span data-math>x=0</span> or <span data-math>y=0</span>) are called the <strong>intercepts</strong> of a graph.</div>
          <div>The x-coordinate of a point on the graph on the x axis is called the <strong>x-intercept</strong> and the y-coordinate of a point on the graph on the y axis is called the <strong>y-intercept</strong>. Intercepts may be found using either the equation or the graph of the equation.</div>
          <div>x-intercepts and y-intercepts can be found respectively by setting <span data-math>y</span> or <span data-math>x</span> to 0 and solving the equation for <span data-math>x</span> or <span data-math>y</span>.</div>

          <h3>Symmetries of graphs</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>A graph is <strong>symmetric with respect to the x-axis</strong> if for every <span data-math>(x,y)</span> on the graph, <span data-math>(x,-y)</span> is also on the graph (this is equivalent to saying that a graph of a equation is symmetric with respect to the x-axis if for all <span data-math>(x,y)</span> satisfying the equation, <span data-math>(x,-y)</span> also satisfies the equation because a point <span data-math>(x,y)</span> satisfying the equation is equivalent to <span data-math>(x,y)</span> being on the equation's graph). </li>
            <li>A graph is <strong>symmetric with respect to the y-axis</strong> if for every <span data-math>(x,y)</span> on the graph, <span data-math>(-x,y)</span> is also on the graph (can also be viewed from the perspective of sets <span data-math>(x,y)</span> satisfying the graph's equation).</li>
            <li>A graph is <strong>symmetric with respect to the origin</strong> if for every <span data-math>(x,y)</span> on the graph, <span data-math>(-x,-y)</span> is also on the graph (can also be viewed from the perspective of sets <span data-math>(x,y)</span> satisfying the graph's equation).</li>
          </ul>
          <div>Equations can be tested for symmetries directly without their graphs.</div>
          <ul>
            <li>The graph of an equation is symmetric with respect to the x-axis if an equivalent equation results from replacing all <span data-math>y</span> with <span data-math>-y</span> in the equation.</li>
            <li>The graph of an equation is symmetric with respect to the x-axis if an equivalent equation results from replacing all <span data-math>x</span> with <span data-math>-x</span> in the equation.</li>
            <li>The graph of an equation is symmetric with respect to the x-axis if an equivalent equation results from replacing all <span data-math>x</span> with <span data-math>-x</span> and <span data-math>y</span> with <span data-math>-y</span> in the equation.</li>
          </ul>
          <div>Equations may sometimes be more easily graphed when properties of equations such as intercepts and symmetries are known.</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="ch-1-3">
        <h2>Lines</h2>
        <div>The graph of a linear equation in two unknowns in a xy-plane is a line, and any line in a xy-plane can be represented by a linear equation in two unknowns.</div>
        <div>
          <h3>Slope</h3>
          <div>The <strong>slope</strong> of a nonvertical line in a xy-plane can be thought of as a measure of the line's "steepness"</div>
          <div>Let <span data-math>(x_1,y_1)</span> and <span data-math>(x_2,y_2)</span> be two distinct points on a nonvertical line, the slope <span data-math>m</span> of the line is defined as
            <div data-math>m=\dfrac{x_2-x_1}{y_2-y_1}\quad x_1 â‰  x_2</div>
            The slope of a nonvertical line is the same regardless of the two points chosen.
          </div>
          <div>The slope of a vertical line is <strong>undefined</strong>.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Equations of a line</h3>
          <div>The <strong>equation of a vertical line</strong> is <div data-math>x=a</div> where <span data-math>a</span> is the x-intercept of the line.</div>
          <div>The <strong>equation of a horizontal line</strong> is <div data-math>y=b</div> where <span data-math>b</span> is the y-intercept of the line.</div>
          <div>The <strong>point-slope form of the equation of a line</strong> is a form of the equation for a nonvertical line. The equation of a nonvertical line with slope <span data-math>m</span> that contains point <span data-math>(x_1,y_1)</span> is <div data-math>y-y_1=m(x-x_1)</div></div>
          <div>The <strong>slope-intercept from of the equation of a line</strong> is a form of the equation for a nonvertical line. The equation of a nonvertical line with slope <span data-math>m</span> and y-intercept <span data-math>b</span> is <div data-math>y=mx+b</div></div>
          <div>The equation of the <strong>general form</strong> or <strong>standard form</strong> of a line is a form of the equation for any line in the xy-plane. It is written as <div data-math>Ax+By+C=0</div> or sometimes<div data-math>Ax+By=C</div> where <span data-math>A</span>, <span data-math>B</span>, and <span data-math>C</span> are real numbers and <span data-math>A</span> and <span data-math>B</span> are not both 0.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Parallel and perpendicular lines</h3>
          <div><strong>Two nonvertical lines are parallel</strong> if and only if their slopes are equal and they have different y-intercepts. (The if and only if means that two separate statements, one the converse of the other are made. In this case it means 1. if two nonvertical lines have equal slopes and different y-intercepts, they are parallel; 2. if two nonvertical lines are parallel, they have equal slopes and different y-intercepts.)</div>
          <div><strong>Two nonvertical lines are perpendicular</strong> if and only if the product of their slopes equals -1.</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="ch-1-4">
        <h2>Circles</h2>
        <div>In the xy-plane, a <strong>circle</strong> is the set of all points a fixed distance <span data-math>r</span> from a fixed center <span data-math>(h,k)</span>. The fixed distance <span data-math>r</span> is the <strong>radius</strong> of the circle, and the fixed point <span data-math>(h,k)</span> is the <strong>center</strong> of the circle.</div>
        <div>The <strong>standard form of an equation of a circle</strong> with radius <span data-math>r</span> and center <span data-math>(h,k)</span> is <div data-math>(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2</div></div>
        <div>When the center is the origin <span data-math>(0,0)</span>, the equation can be written as <div data-math>x^2+y^2=r^2</div></div>
        <div>The circle with radius <span data-math>r=1</span> and center at origin <span data-math>(0,0)</span> is called the <strong>unit circle</strong>, with equation <div data-math>x^2+y^2=1</div></div>
        <div>When the graph of an equation is a circle, the <strong>general form of an equation of a circle</strong> is an equation of the form <div data-math>x^2+y^2+ax+by+c=0</div></div>
        <div>The equation <span data-math>x^2+y^2+ax+by+c=0</span> with arbitrary real <span data-math>a</span>, <span data-math>b</span>, and <span data-math>c</span> represents a circle only for some <span data-math>a</span>, <span data-math>b</span>, and <span data-math>c</span>. In other cases, it may represent one point or no points.</div>
        <div>An equation of a circle can be converted between the standard form and general form.</div>

      <h1>2. Functions and their graphs</h1>
      <div id="ch-2-1">
        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <div>A <strong>function</strong> is a relation that associates two sets (usually the set of real numbers or a subset of the set of real numbers, but also may be the set of complex numbers or other sets) <span data-math>X</span> and <span data-math>Y</span> such that each element of <span data-math>X</span> is associated with exactly one element of <span data-math>Y</span></div>
        <div>The set <span data-math>X</span> is called the <strong>domain</strong> of the function. For each element <span data-math>x</span> in <span data-math>X</span>, the corresponding element <span data-math>y</span> in <span data-math>Y</span> is called the value of the function at <span data-math>x</span>, or the <strong>image</strong> of <span data-math>x</span>. The set of all images of the elements of the domain is called the <strong>range</strong> of the function. The range is always a subset of <span data-math>Y</span>, but is not necessarily equal to <span data-math>Y</span>. A function may be a "one-to-one" or "many-to-one" relation, but a "one-to-many" relationship is not a function. The value of a function for a given input is determined by the input.</div>
        <div>A function may be represented as a letter, such as <span data-math>f</span>, and the notation <span data-math>f(x)</span>represents the value of <span data-math>f</span> for input <span data-math>x</span>. <span data-math>f(x)</span> is also sometimes to represent the function itself.</div>
        <div>
          <h3>Representations of functions</h3>
          <div>A function may be represented as a diagram of the relation between two sets <span data-math>X</span> and <span data-math>Y</span> that indicate the association between elements in <span data-math>X</span> and <span data-math>Y</span>.</div>
          <div>A function may be represented by an equation. For an equation to represent a function, every value of the independent variable in the domain of the function must have exactly one corresponding value of the dependent variable.</div>
          <div>For example, the equation <span data-math>x + y = 3</span> can represent a function with independent variable <span data-math>x</span> and dependent variable <span data-math>y</span>. The function can be rewritten as <span data-math>y = x - 3</span> to show that every <span data-math>x</span> in the domain (in this case the set of real numbers) corresponds to exactly one <span data-math>y</span>.</div>
          <div>As another example, the equation <span data-math>y^2 = x</span> does not represent a function with independent variable <span data-math>x</span> (with the domain being the set of real numbers) and dependent variable <span data-math>y</span>. Solving for <span data-math>y</span>, we see that <span data-math>y = \pm \sqrt{x}</span>, meaning that except for <span data-math>x = 0</span>, every <span data-math>x</span> corresponds to two distinct <span data-math>y</span>'s.</div>
          <div>A function may also be specified by its graph. A graph is a set of points. A set of points <span data-math>(x, y)</span>, either represented by a graph or otherwise, represents a function with independent variable <span data-math>x</span> and dependent variable <span data-math>y</span> if and only if there is at most one point with any given <span data-math>x</span>.</div>
